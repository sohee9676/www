                                        Long ago, a drop of magical sunlight falls from the sky and sprouts a flower with healing powers. 
                                        Upon discovering it, an old beggar woman named Mother Gothel hides the flower and uses it to stay young 
                                        for centuries, until royal soldiers from the nearby kingdom of Corona find and uproot it to save 
                                        their pregnant and ill Queen. The Queen gives birth to a baby princess with long golden hair. 
                                        While the king and queen are sleeping one evening, Gothel discovers the hair has the same powers 
                                        as the flower, but turns brown and becomes powerless when cut. She kidnaps the girl, 
                                        named Rapunzel, and raises her in a hidden tower in the woods, using her hair to stay young.

                                        Each year, on Rapunzel's birthday, the king and queen release thousands of sky lanterns 
                                        in hope she will see them and return home. Rapunzel becomes obsessed with the distant lights, 
                                        and, on the eve of her 18th birthday, asks Gothel for permission to see them closer. Gothel refuses, 
                                        claiming that the outside world is dangerous and Rapunzel is too weak and young to survive in it. Later, 
                                        handsome thief Flynn Rider steals Rapunzel's intended crown from the palace, abandons his partners, 
                                        the Stabbington brothers, and takes refuge in the tower. Rapunzel knocks him out and hides him in a closet. 
                                        She tries to show him to Gothel as proof she is capable of taking care of herself; 
                                    </p>

                                        however, Gothel refuses to listen, so Rapunzel sends Gothel on a three-day journey 
                                        to get new paints as a birthday gift.
                                        Rapunzel hides the crown and tells Flynn he can only get it back by taking her to see the lights. 
                                        Along the way, they stop at the Snuggly Duckling pub, where menacing thugs try to capture the wanted Flynn. 
                                        Rapunzel soon charms them into revealing their softer sides; when royal guards arrive, 
                                        the thugs help her and Flynn to escape. Meanwhile, Gothel becomes suspicious, returns to the empty tower, 
                                        and finds the crown.

                                        She sets out to find Rapunzel, and allies herself with the Stabbington brothers.
                                        In escaping from the guards, Flynn and Rapunzel become trapped in a fast-flooding cave. 
                                        Thinking they will die, Flynn resignedly reveals his true name (Eugene Fitzherbert) 
                                        and Rapunzel reveals her magic powers. Her glowing hair shows a previously hidden exit, 
                                        and they escape and take refuge in the woods. That night, Gothel catches up to 
                                        Rapunzel while Eugene is away, gives her the crown, and tells her to use it to test Eugene's loyalty.
